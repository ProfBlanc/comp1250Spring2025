Why create class?
    When you want to create a thing that
        has attributes/properties (values)
            declared as variables
        has actions
            declared as methods

Classes have special functions
    start and end with double underscore
        __NAME__
            where NAME is text


class definition
    blueprint, template, model to be followed to reproduce something

an instance of a class
    aka object
    the result of the creation of the class
        CLASS_NAME()

what is self?
    a keyword that refers to the INSTANCE of the class
